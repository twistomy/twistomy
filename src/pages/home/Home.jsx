Together, our team developed a patented, discreet, and low-profile continent ostomy device that empowers patients to regain control of their bowel habits. Twistomy™ is designed to minimize peristomal complications, reduce the physical burden of traditional ostomies, and support a more confident, active lifestyle by enhancing overall quality of life.",

              text: "An ostomy is an external facing, surgically diverted segment of small or large bowel created by a surgeon that results in the formation of a temporary or permanent stoma. Stoma output is managed with an obtrusive ostomy pouch system, composed of a peristomal wafer with an adhesive backing and a heavy-duty plastic bag to collect fecal material. Nearly 70% of ostomy patients experience leakage from underneath the wafer, resulting in malodor, embarrassment, and peristomal skin complications.  Peristomal skin complications result in frequent hospital visits, longer stays, and higher readmission rates. Pouching systems also produce unsolicited noise, malodor, and pose significant psychosocial challenges often leading to social isolation, depression in nearly half, and reduced quality of life.",
