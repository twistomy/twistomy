    question: "How do you know the device prevents leakage and odor?",
    answer:
      "We’ve conducted extensive benchtop testing using simulated waste, artificial bowels, and a high-fidelity stoma mannequin to ensure TwistomyTM is both air- and effluent-tight. Preliminary verification testing was performed using well-defined protocols focused on effluent- airtightness—no leakage was observed over 12 hours after equilibration and no air leakage was detected over a four-hour test period, confirming the effluent- and airtight integrity of the device.",
  },
  {
    question: "What wafer is TwistomyTM currently compatible with?",
    answer: "Twistomy™ is currently compatible with the Coloplast SenSura® Mio Convex Wafer, a widely used and trusted option among ostomates. Future versions may support additional wafer systems as we continue development and testing.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often do I need to empty the device?",
    answer:
      "We recommend emptying the device every 2 to 6 hours, depending on your individual output levels. Frequency may vary based on diet, health, and daily activity. Twistomy™ is designed for daytime use and easy to empty, helping you maintain comfort and confidence throughout the day.",
